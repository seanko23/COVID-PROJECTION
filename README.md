# COVID-PROJECTION

This is my personal project of interest on COVID-19. It will have graphs that will show the accumulated confirmed COVID-19 cases in the states: California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, and New York.


Later on, this will include forecasting and regression of COVID-19 cases through ML.
